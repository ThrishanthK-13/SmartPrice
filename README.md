🧠 Fruit Price Prediction Using CNN (Future Agmarknet Integration)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict fruit prices based on image features and visual quality. The current version focuses on image-based prediction, while integration with Agmarknet market data is planned as a future enhancement to improve accuracy and provide deeper insights.

The model is trained on fruit images and corresponding price labels to analyze factors such as ripeness, size, and texture. It aims to help farmers, traders, and consumers estimate fair prices efficiently using a simple and automated approach.

🔍 Features:

CNN-based fruit classification and price prediction

Automated image preprocessing and feature extraction

Clean workflow for training, testing, and updating the model

Visual comparison between predicted and actual prices

Future integration planned with Agmarknet for market analysis

🧰 Technologies Used:

Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

CNN model for image-driven price prediction

(Planned) Agmarknet data integration for improved forecasting

🎯 Outcome:
A functional system capable of predicting fruit prices using image data, with plans to incorporate real-time market datasets in future versions for more accurate and actionable results.
